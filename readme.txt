| Roman Numerals to Hindu-Arabic Number Format |
|----------------------------------------------|

Within the java file is a class called convertFormat
with a method called toHinArab(). This method takes a Roman Numeral
string as a parameter and returns the equivalent Hindu-Arabic number
By checking each character in the string, the method determines the
value of each character and adds it to the total. If the value of the
current character is less than the value of the next character, the
method subtracts the current value from the total. Otherwise, the
method adds the current value to the total. The method returns the
total.
